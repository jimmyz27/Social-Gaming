# Project Workflow Guide

### General Workflow
* Never push directly into master. Always create a separate branch when making any chance, no matter how small
* Consistently merge master branch into your working branch to reduce the size of merge conflicts.
* Never delete any branches (as per the course rules)

### Build


### Code Review
* It is generally advisable to create a WIP ("Work-In-Progress") merge request when a branch is not completed, but still needs some review (or to show progress).
* Any MR that is not marked as WIP is assumed to be completed work (but not necessary code reviewed).
* Any MR must have at least 2 thumbs up from other teammates prior to being merged. The person who made the merge request must be responsible for merging the branch.
